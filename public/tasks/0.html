e<strong>X</strong>press <strong>D</strong>ata <strong>P</strong>ath is a new
technology for fast packet processing at the lowest part of the stack. It's a
solution that is competing with userspace solutions like DPKD.

XDP supports a couple of actions, which you can read all about at <a
href="http://prototype-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networking/XDP/implementation/xdp_actions.html">prototype-kernel</a>.

For this round the main goal is to take the program below and make it drop all
incoming packets.

<pre>
#include <linux/bpf.h>

#ifndef __section
# define __section(NAME)                                                \
        __attribute__((section(NAME), used))
#endif

__section("xdp")
int xdp_drop(struct xdp_md *ctx)
{
        return XDP_PASS;
}

char __license[] __section("license") = "GPL";
</pre>
