# xdp-playground

A place to experiment with [XDP][0]. The idea is to have a interactive place
with some challenges that teach you more about XDP while you experiment. This
is a work in progress and the framework for writing a challenge is in the works
also the program execution part is progressing.

## Adding a challenge

TODO: explain structure of tasks/$task.txt
TODO: how explain how tasks are verified by [`bpf_prog_test_run_xdp`][1].
