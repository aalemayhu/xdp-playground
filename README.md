# XDP playground

This is a open list challenge to help you learn to write real XDP programs.  The
playground consists of pages which can either be interactive tasks or reading
material. In the interactive tasks you are expected to write XDP programs which
get verified by the playground.

A running instance of the playground is available at http://playground.xdp.no/
If you'd like to submit a challenge for inclusion to the playground, please see
[Adding a challenge](./Challenge.md). Writing new challenges is welcomed and
appreciated but other contributions like rewording or typo fixes are also very
welcome. See [Run XDP playground](./Development.md).
