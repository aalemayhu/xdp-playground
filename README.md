# XDP playground

This is a open list challenge to help you learn to write real XDP programs.  The  
playground consists of pages which can either be interactive tasks or reading  
material. In the interactive tasks you are expected to write XDP programs which  
get verified by the playground.

A running instance of the playground is available at https://playground.xdp.no/  
If you'd like to submit a challenge for inclusion to the playground, please  
[Adding a challenge](./Challenge.md). Writing new challenges is welcomed and  
appreciated but other contributions like rewording or typo fixes are also very  
welcome. See [Run XDP playground](./Development.md).
