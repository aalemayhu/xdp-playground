o use new test framework patches.

Have to create a setup for writing the verification programs.  Then those
programs run the compiled user XDP program.

o The server and UI should be decoupled.

The main reasons being security and flexibility. The server is running user
input which means that it can crash and take down the UI with it.  Having the
server in a separate VM reduces the direct impact it has on the web
application.  Also the server needs a fairly new kernel where the Angular
application only needs a JavaScript environment, it's dependencies and
something serving like NGINX so the URLs are mapped correctly. For now having
it in one place works, but this should be fixed overtime.
